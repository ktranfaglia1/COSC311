#  This program takes three inputs (outlook, humidity, and wind) and generates a decision tree model

# Function that determines if the user should play tennis and returns a flag denoting answer (0 - false, 1 - true)

    status = 0  # Set status to false (default)
    # Check for a condition that endorces playing tennis and set status to 1 if condition is met ... nesting not necessary
