Task 1: Data Segmentation - segmentation of data with sliding window.
Task 2: Feature Extraction - Each segment is used to extract multiple features to represent an activity.
Task 3: Dataset Generation - Combination of all features and corresponding activity labels to generate sample. Features
normalized before model train and test
Task 4: Model Training and testing - Experiment to compare classifiers and find the best classifier for the dataset.
The best classifier is denoted by best overall performance in modeling data (accurate labeling)
Task 5: Experience and Potential Improvements - Reflection of project
